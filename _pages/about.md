Welcome! I am **Ahmed Tahseen Minhaz**, a data scientist and AI researcher currently working at **Philips - Image Guided Therapy Devices (IGTD)**. I specialize in the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in medical imaging and life sciences, with a focus on diagnostics, therapeutics, and clinical decision support.

With over 8 years of experience across academia and industry, I’ve developed robust AI systems for medical imaging, including 3D ultrasound, CT, and X-ray modalities. I’m especially passionate about integrating cutting-edge models into real-world healthcare workflows, ensuring both clinical impact and computational efficiency.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======

All of this content is managed through structured Markdown files — making it clean, portable, and easy to version control. For example, I use CSV-to-Markdown generators to keep publication and talk lists up to date, and all assets (PDFs, datasets, images) are stored in the repository for full reproducibility and transparency.

If you’re an academic, researcher, or professional looking to set up your own site, I recommend forking [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and modifying it to suit your needs — no ads, and no cost.

Tools and capabilities supported
======

This template supports popular visualization and rendering tools:
- 📐 **MathJax** for equations  
- 📊 **Plotly** for interactive plots  
- 🔄 **Mermaid** for diagrams  

Additionally, scripts such as [talkmap.ipynb](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) allow you to analyze metadata (e.g., where you’ve presented talks), turning structured YAML front-matter into rich visualizations.
